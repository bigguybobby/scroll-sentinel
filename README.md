# 🛡️ Scroll Sentinel — On-Chain Security Monitoring for Scroll

> Built for the Scroll Security Subsidy Program

## Concept
Real-time on-chain security monitoring and alerting system for smart contracts deployed on Scroll. Monitors for suspicious patterns, reentrancy attempts, flash loan attacks, and abnormal state changes.

## Features
1. **Contract Monitoring** — Register contracts for continuous monitoring
2. **Pattern Detection** — Detect suspicious tx patterns (large withdrawals, reentrancy, flash loans)
3. **Alert System** — On-chain alert registry with severity levels
4. **Security Score** — Dynamic security score based on contract behavior
5. **Historical Analysis** — Track all security events for a contract

## Tech Stack
- Solidity + Foundry (on-chain monitoring contracts)
- Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind (dashboard)
- Scroll Sepolia (deployment)

## Status
🚧 In development
